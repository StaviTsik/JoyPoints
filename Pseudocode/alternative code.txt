1. Set year = 2011           // Start from 2011
2. Set total_joy_points = 0   // Initialize total joy points counter
3. Set match_counter = 0      // Initialize match counter to count matches for each year
4. For each year from 2011 to 2015:
    a. Print "Starting calculations for year [year]"   // Output the current year
    
    b. For each match in the year (1 to 30):
        i. Input match details: 
            - goals_scored_by_selected_team (integer)
            - match_result ("win", "draw", "lose")
            - team_type ("home", "away")
        
        ii. Add joy points for goals scored:
            - joy_points_for_goals = goals_scored_by_selected_team
            - Add joy_points_for_goals to total_joy_points
        
        iii. Check if the selected team won:
            - If match_result == "win":
                - Add 3 joy points for the win:
                  - If team_type == "home" OR team_type == "away":
                      - Add 3 joy points to total_joy_points
        
        iv. Increment match_counter by 1
        
        v. If match_counter == 30:
            - Print "End of year [year] calculations"
            - Reset match_counter to 0
        
    c. Increment year by 1 (move to the next year)

5. Print "Total joy points accumulated from 2011 to 2015: [total_joy_points]"
