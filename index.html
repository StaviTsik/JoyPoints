        <h2>Measuring Joypoints for Superettan Fans!</h2>
        <p>Is there a way to measure joy for the fans at a football teams home game? For this project we have selected Superettan as our football league to measure their teams joy at home game during the years.</p>
        <img src="/Website_material/fans.jpg" alt="Superettan Football" class="responsive-image">
        </p>For each game played the teams will be given a score depending on the match results such as win, draw or loss. Once they have played 30 games during a specific period the league season is finished.</p>
