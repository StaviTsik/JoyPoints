            <h2>Our project's goal</h2>
              <p>Our project wants to answer this problem: How much joy was offered by any of the teams to their fans during the football season during a specific period? (How much joy did the team give to their fans during a home game during a specific period?) This is the problem we intend to solve.<p>
             </p>To make our enquiry more specific we put some ranges that put the teams, based on their score, into a certain category.</p>
             </p>The categories are five, from A to E and they go as follows:</p>
             <style>
                table {
                    border-collapse: collapse;
                    width: 50%;
                }
                th, td {
                    border: 1px solid black;
                    padding: 8px;
                    text-align: left;
                }
                th {
                    background-color: #f2f2f2;
                }
            </style>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>JoyPoints</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>A</td>
                    <td>≥ 300</td>
                </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td>B</td>
                    <td>250-299</td>     
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>C</td>
                    <td>150-249</td>     
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>D</td>
                    <td>51-149</td>     
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>E</td>
                    <td>0-50</td>     
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>For example, if the score is equal or more than 300, the team will be included in category A. The Super joyous fans! <br>
            On the other hand, if the score is below or equal to 50, then something would have gone wrong and the team will be included in category E, the poor, poor and miserable fans… </p>
