        <h2>Dataset</h2>
        <section>
            <p>The dataset for our project included five full seasons of Superettan. It is a convenient dataset because it primarily contains numerical data, making manipulation easier for our algorithm's needs.</p>
            <p>All data were extracted from <a href="url"><www class="flashscore.com"></www></a>, a site dedicated to sports data across various disciplines.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that all the data are real, which required careful recording and consequently took many hours.</p>

            <h2>What are JoyPoints?</h2>
            <p><i>JoyPoints are the sum of points any team gathers from their home wins and specifically from the number of goals it scores plus the amount of joy after the referee’s final whistle.
                A home goal offers 1 unit of Joy and a home win offers 5 units.</i></p>
            <p>JoyPoints (we will use it in one word as a technical term) are units of joy. They are referred to as carefully selected by us occasions, that of scoring a goal and celebrating a win.</p>
            <p>To be even more specific, we focus on home matches because we want, in order to restrict the results, to concentrate on the experience of the people who watch the game live from the stands.</p>
            <p>Let’s assume this is “pure joy” for a fan and JoyPoints are intended to measure it! When a team scores a goal, it makes their fans very happy, but not extremely.</p>
            <p>After all, scoring a number of goals does not guarantee the result of the game in terms of JoyPoints? This happiness is limited, so we will attribute to it only 1 JoyPoint. But when the final whistle is blown and the home team has won, local fans become super enthusiastic and proud. Therefore, the joy is greater and lasts longer. So, we attribute to it 5 JoyPoints. The combination of the JoyPoints gives a number for every team’s home game.</p>
